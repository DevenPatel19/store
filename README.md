## 6/15
 - Did I lose the plot? I initially started out with a recipe app to showcase skills, this quickly evolved into
 an Ecommerce idea for my friend but she no long was pursing her small businees, I then started leaning towards
 an inventory app so that I could gain confidence... and now I'm lost. I even had a plan. Bakc to the template
 for an 

  - inventory management system
  - a booking system with customer contact database
  - payment gateway through Stripe API,  as well as retaining the 
  - JWT AUTH Reg/Log screen and the 
  - Add/Edit same use product form for inventory branch 
  
  of MVP.
